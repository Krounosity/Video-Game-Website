            Genshin Impact takes place in the fantasy world of Teyvat, home to
            seven nations, each of which is tied to a different element and
            ruled by a different god. The story follows the Traveler, an
            inter-dimensional adventurer who, at the start of the game, is
            separated from their twin sibling after the two land in Teyvat.
            Thereafter, the Traveler journeys across the nations of Teyvat in
            search of the lost sibling, accompanied by their guide, Paimon.
            Along the way, the two befriend myriad individuals and begin to
            unravel the mysteries of the land.<sup

            In Brawl Stars, players battle against other players or AI opponents
            in multiple game modes. Players can choose between characters called
            Brawlers that they have unlocked through Boxes, the Brawl Pass, the
            Trophy Road, or purchased through the Shop to use in battles. In
            December 2022, Boxes were removed, and all previous methods to get
            them were replaced with credits and chroma credits, which are used
            to unlock Brawlers, who are now mostly placed on the "Starr
            Road".<sup><a href="#refer2">[2]</a></sup>

            Described as "soccer, but with rocket-powered cars", Rocket League
            has up to eight players assigned to each of the two teams, using
            rocket-powered vehicles to hit a ball into their opponent's goal and
            score points over the course of a match. The game includes
            single-player and multiplayer modes that can be played both locally
            and online, including cross-platform play between all versions.
            Later updates for the game enabled the ability to modify core rules
            and added new game modes, including ones based on ice hockey and
            basketball.<sup><a href="#refer3">[3]</a></sup>
